# @solstatus/api

## Overview
Built 100% on Cloudflare, using Workers, Durable Objects, and D1. A quick explanation of the architecture:
- Each endpoint has its own Durable Object, known as the Trigger. This acts as a programmable CronJob via the Alarm API
- The Trigger calls a Worker, known as the Executioner. 
    - This is a fire and forget call via `waitUntil()` â€” minimizing the time the Durable Object is running and thus its cost (charged for Wall Time)
- The Executioner handles making the request to the respective endpoint and updating the DB
    - This is extremely cost effective since Workers are charged for CPU Time, and waiting on I/O tasks like this costs nothing 

## Development

It is suggested to run dev from the root of the repo, as there are other services that should be running. More details on that in the root [README](../../README.md#local-dev).
