# @solstatus/app

## Overview
Standard NextJS v15, shadcn, TailwindCSS v4, and Drizzle stack. Some other notable points:
- pnpm as package manager
- biome as linter/formatter
- zustand for state management
- opennext with the CF adapter (not that it changes much)
- OpenAPI support via scalar

## Development

It is suggested to run dev from the root of the repo, as there are other services that should be running. More details on that in the root [README](../../README.md#local-dev).
